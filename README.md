The purpose of this project is to consolidate some of the learned insights throughout the years about the <b>Clean Architecture</b> principles and reflect those lessons on Android, taking advantage of the Kotlin programming language features too.
<br/><br>This project summarises some of the general use cases and demands on a typical production project using: <b>Jetpack Compose</b>, <b>Functional Programming</b>,<b>MVI</b>, <b>Kotlin Coroutines</b> and <b>Kotlin Flows</b></p> 
Build a simple app to hit the NY Times Most Popular Articles API and show a list of articles, that
shows details when items on the list are tapped.

## Libraries Used :books:

* [Compose][0] Toolkit for building native UI (in a declarative way - 100% Kotlin).
* [Coroutines][1] Library support for Kotlin coroutines.
* [Flows][2] Stream processing API, built on top of Coroutines.
* [Dagger Hilt][3] Dependency injection library for Android.
* [Retrofit][4] Type-safe REST client for Android to consume RESTful web services.
* [Timber][5] Logger with a small API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [MockK][6] mocking framework for testing.
* [Coil Compose][7] Image downloading and caching library supported by Jetpack Compose.
* [Lottie Compose][8] Library that provides that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as
  json with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile.
* [Shot][9] Shot is a Gradle plugin and a core android library thought to run screenshot tests for
  Android.

## Modules :bookmark_tabs:

* **app** - The application module with access to **all the application**
* **data** - Android module that **can only access domain module**
* **data-api** - Android module that **can only access data module**
* **domain** - Kotlin module that **cannot access any other module**

### Unit Testing

There are some highlights:

* Every layer in the architecture has been tested.
* MockK has been used for mocking | stubbing.
* `Given | When | Then` code presentation order, in order to give a more structured style.
